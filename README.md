The page contain the code, which was applied for data analysis of the corresponding experiment. 

The code is split into 3 steps: 
1) Sensor space analysis;
2) Source space anylysis;
3) Connectivity analysis.

All steps are split into 2 parts: individual processing and group statitics. 

If you want to use the code, change variables only in the files for particular level (files, which do not start from the word "Function"). If you want to change the pipeline, change the Functions file.
